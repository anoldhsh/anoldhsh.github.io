Hello! My name is Seokhyun (Shawn) Hwang, and I'm a <strong>Ph.D. student in Information
Science</strong> at the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/"

              href='/EXTRAS'><strong>EXTRA
ACTIVITIES</strong></a>. My research interests lie in the field of Human-Computer Interaction and Virtual/Augmented Reality systems. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the interactions between humans and VR/AR systems, and how we can create more realistic and immersive experiences through the use of hardware devices.

I have been working on developing my own VR locomotion method and haptic feedback device, which I am building with my understanding of circuits and mechanics. My goal is to create a device that can enhance the user's sense of presence and immersion in virtual environments.
