* This study explored bone-conduction vibration (BCV) in redirected walking (RDW), a technology for seamless walking in large virtual spaces within confined physical areas, enhancing obstacle avoidance performance using nonelectrical vestibular stimulation without the side effects caused by electrical stimulation. 

* We proposed four different BCV stimulation methods and evaluated their detection threshold (DT) extension performance and user experience in virtual reality (VR) conditions. 

* The DT was successfully expanded from at least 23% to 45% under all BCV conditions while preserving the immersion and presence. Notably, user comfort increased when content sound was used for vestibular stimulation. 

* Under the extended DT condition, a simulation study demonstrated that all BCV stimulation methods facilitated uninterrupted walking over extended distances when applying RDW to users with random movements. 

* Thus, this research established the viability of using BCV in RDW applications and the potential for incorporating content sound into BCV stimulation techniques. <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/ismar/2023/283800b181/1SBIOSZTWlG"><strong>(Paper Link)</strong></a>
