### Abstract:

Redirected walking (RDW) visually manipulates the movement of the virtual environment (VE) such that the movement of the real environment (RE) and VE are no longer matched 1:1. With RDW, users can overcome the spatial constraints of RE, such as furniture, walls, and columns, and freely move the wider VE using natural gait motion. However, when the intensity of visual manipulations increases, people notice the RDW manipulation owing to visual-vestibular inconsistency, and experience discomfort like motion sickness. To address visual-vestibular inconsistency, we modulated vestibular information in various directions to match the modulation of visual information using galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS). We proposed a new RDW system—REVES: redirection enhancement using four-pole vestibular electrode stimulation. REVES stimulates the user’s vestibular system according to various visual modulation directions using four-pole GVS based on the proposed algorithm. REVES changed the detection threshold of RDW in three manipulation cases: rotation, translation, and walking direction.
