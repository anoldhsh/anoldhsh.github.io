* This study examines the feasibility of user-applied active locomotion in In-Car Virtual Reality (VR), overcoming the passivity in mobility of previous In-Car VR experiences where the virtual movement was synchronized with the real movement of the car.

* We present the concept of virtual steering gains to quantify the magnitude of user-applied redirection from the real car's path. Through a user study where participants applied various levels of steering gains in an active virtual driving task, we assessed usability factors through measures of motion sickness, spatial presence, and overall acceptance.

* Results indicate a range of acceptable steering gains in which active locomotion improves spatial presence without significantly increasing motion sickness. Future works will attempt to further validate a steering gain threshold in which active locomotion in In-Car VR can be applicable.
