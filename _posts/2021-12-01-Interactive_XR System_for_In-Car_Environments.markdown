* The project "Interactive XR System for In-Car Environments Using Natural User Interface (NUI)" is a novel advancement in integrating Augmented Reality (AR) into automotive environments. It focuses on delivering an immersive AR experience inside a vehicle, utilizing NUI principles for interaction. This system uses AR markers for spatial tracking of a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) within the moving car, ensuring alignment and stability of the AR content in relation to the vehicle's interior dynamics.

* A key component is a stereo camera mounted at the vehicle's front, responsible for recognizing AR markers and creating a pass-through Virtual Reality (VR) environment. This setup merges virtual content with the external real-world view, vital for a consistent, immersive experience. Moreover, the system's ability to determine depth using the stereo camera is crucial. It allows for the occlusion of physical structures and certain AR elements within the car, ensuring virtual objects are accurately positioned and overlaid in the user's field of view.

* Addressing the spatial constraints of a car's interior, the system incorporates a stereo infrared (IR) camera for detecting and interpreting the user's hand movements. This feature enables the control and manipulation of game content through hand gestures, adhering to NUI principles. This approach reduces the need for physical contact with devices, enhancing safety and convenience.

* In summary, the project represents a significant step in AR technology application within the automotive sector. It combines AR markers, depth sensing, and gesture recognition to provide an intuitive and immersive AR experience in a confined and dynamic environment. This development highlights the potential of AR in enhancing user interaction in everyday scenarios, particularly where space is limited.
