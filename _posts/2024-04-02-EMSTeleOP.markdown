#### Research Goal

* Most teleoperation systems using robotic arms rely on simple joystick controls, but recent advancements in VR technology have spurred research into VR-based teleoperation.

* Systems where remote operators wearing VR headsets command robotic arms for specific tasks typically use the robot's vision system to position control the arm's end effector.

* Remote control using VR offers the advantage of a more immersive environment, allowing users to instruct remote tasks using natural human motion. However, many current studies limit remote operators to directing tasks based solely on restricted vision information.

* While robots used in daily life and work often detect force changes corresponding to actions using force-feedback systems, enabling precision similar to human tasks, users in teleoperation situations do not receive adequate force-feedback, making precise tasks challenging.

* Therefore, this study aims to support precise force control tasks in teleoperation by using EMS to provide remote operators with the forces acting on the robot arm's end effector.


#### System Overview

* The objective is to provide muscle activation differences between the virtual user model in the environment and the real user model, thereby delivering the external force of the virtual environment.

* The required system in this study should have the following functionalities:

    * Calculate user's joint coordinates through motion capture.
    * Compute the user's current joint torque and the necessary muscle activation (the user's actual muscle activation).
    * Calculate joint torque considering external force (external force based on walking conditions in a virtual environment, i.e., virtual user's muscle activation or target activation).
    * Provide EMS stimulation of appropriate intensity based on the difference from target activation.



#### Computational Musculotendon Model (Planned)

* We will use muscle modeling based on the Millard et al. 2012 Equilibrium Muscle model.

* This model simplifies muscle characteristics to enable a computational approach.

* An equilibrium model assumes that the forces generated by the fiber and tendon are equal.

* Muscle activation satisfying estimated muscle force from musculoskeletal model and simulation is calculated through predefined muscle parameters, determining the intensity of the EMS signal.

#### Implementation (In Progress)

* Before implementing a full upper-body simulation, we are currently studying using a lower limb model.

* The following shows the progress of implementing a biomechanical simulation in Unity based on an OpenSim model.

* We are conducting motion capture using multiple IMUs; below are the current implementations of the system.

* In addition, for real-time VR teleoperation implementation, a UR3 operating environment based on Unity has been developed, and below is its progress.
