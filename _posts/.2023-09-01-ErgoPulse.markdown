* This research presents a cutting-edge system that merges biomechanical simulations with electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) to deliver kinesthetic force feedback to the lower extremities in virtual reality (VR). 

* This system is composed of two key elements: a biomechanical simulation component that calculates joint torques in the lower body to simulate forces encountered in VR scenarios, and an EMS component that transforms these torques into muscle activations. 

* In the initial experiment, the study examined participants' ability to differentiate between haptic force intensity and direction, noting differences in perceived resolution based on the force's direction. 

* The second experiment, conducted in varied VR gaming environments featuring both continuous and impulse forces, aimed to determine the system's impact on enhancing user engagement and presence. 

* Feedback from users indicated that the system's haptic feedback corresponded well with VR's audio-visual elements, thereby improving the overall sense of presence. 

* Users also suggested improvements for the haptic experience, including the incorporation of additional sensory feedback such as temperature variation, skin stretching, and impact-related devices.
